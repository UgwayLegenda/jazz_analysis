Frank Sinatra,My Way,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way",277,1997.0,and now the end is near and so i face the final curtain my friend i ll say it clear i ll state my case of which i m certain i ve lived a life that s full i traveled each and every highway and more much more than this i did it my way regrets i ve had a few but then again too few to mention i did what i had to do and saw it through without exemption i planned each charted course each careful step along the byway and more much more than this i did it my way yes there were times i m sure you knew when i bit off more than i could chew but through it all when there was doubt i ate it up and spit it out i faced it all and i stood tall and did it my way i ve loved i ve laughed and cried i ve had my fill my share of losing and now as tears subside i find it all so amusing to think i did all that and may i say not in a shy way oh no oh no not me i did it my way for what is a man what has he got if not himself then he has naught to say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels the record shows i took the blows and did it my way yes it was my way,"['end', 'near', 'face', 'final', 'curtain', 'friend', 'clear', 'state', 'case', 'certain', 'live', 'life', 'travel', 'highway', 'way', 'regret', 'mention', 'see', 'exemption', 'plan', 'chart', 'course', 'careful', 'step', 'byway', 'way', 'yes', 'time', 'sure', 'know', 'bit', 'chew', 'doubt', 'eat', 'spit', 'face', 'stand', 'tall', 'way', 'love', 'laugh', 'cry', 'fill', 'share', 'lose', 'tear', 'subside', 'find', 'amusing', 'think', 'shy', 'way', 'way', 'man', 'get', 'naught', 'thing', 'truly', 'feel', 'word', 'kneel', 'record', 'show', 'take', 'blow', 'way', 'yes', 'way']",end near face final curtain friend clear state case certain live life travel highway way regret mention see exemption plan chart course careful step byway way yes time sure know bit chew doubt eat spit face stand tall way love laugh cry fill share lose tear subside find amusing think shy way way man get naught thing truly feel word kneel record show take blow way yes way
Frank Sinatra,That’s Life,"That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinning around
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it

Frank Sinatra,The Girl From Ipanema (Garota De Ipanema),"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes ""ah""
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes  ""ooh""
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesn't see, doesn't see
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado parece um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar..
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly
Ah, porque tudo é tão triste
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall, tan, young, lovely

And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue

I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
""Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality""
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear
""Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?

In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, ""Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow""

Oooooh-Wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, ""Let it snow, let it snow""

But that fire Is ummm... delightful

But he's got high hopes
He's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time you're gettin' low

Oops, there goes another rubber tree plant
When troubles call
And your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned:

Once there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram scram;
He kept buttin' that dam

He had high hopes
He had high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time you're feelin' bad
'Stead of feelin' sad

Frank Sinatra,I’m a Fool to Want You,"I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say
Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you

Frank Sinatra,The Lady Is a Tramp,"She gets too hungry for dinner at eight

Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls

To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
Feelin' so bad
Can't you make the music easy and sad?
I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy
Won't you listen to me
'Til it's talked away?
Well, that's how it goes
And, Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
But this torch that I've found
It's gotta be drowned or it soon might explode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

Frank Sinatra,If You Go Away,"Then you might as well take the sun away;
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high;
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been, or will be again;
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go, I'll be dying slowly till the next hello
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been, or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go, I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
Please don't go away",215,1958.0,then you might as well take the sun away all the birds that flew in the summer sky when our love was new and our hearts were high when the day was young and the night was long and the moon stood still for the night bird s song if you go away if you go away if you go away but if you stay i ll make you a day like no day has been or will be again we ll sail the sun we ll ride on the rain we ll talk to the trees and worship the wind then if you go i ll understand leave me just enough love to fill up my hand if you go away if you go away if you go away if you go as i know you will you must tell the world to stop turning till you return again if you ever do for what good is love without loving you can i tell you now as you turn to go i ll be dying slowly till the next hello if you go away if you go away if you go away but if you stay i ll make you a night like no night has been or will be again i ll sail on your smile i ll ride on your touch i ll talk to your eyes that i love so much but if you go go i won t cry though the good is gone from the word goodbye if you go away if you go away if you go away if you go away as i know you must there ll be nothing left in the world to trust just an empty room full of empty space like the empty look i see on your face i d have been the shadow of your shadow if i thought it might have kept me by your side if you go away if you go away if you go away please don t go away,"['sun', 'away', 'bird', 'fly', 'summer', 'sky', 'love', 'new', 'heart', 'high', 'day', 'young', 'night', 'long', 'moon', 'stand', 'night', 'bird', 'song', 'away', 'away', 'away', 'stay', 'day', 'like', 'day', 'sail', 'sun', 'ride', 'rain', 'talk', 'tree', 'worship', 'wind', 'understand', 'leave', 'love', 'fill', 'hand', 'away', 'away', 'away', 'know', 'tell', 'world', 'stop', 'turn', 'till', 'return', 'good', 'love', 'love', 'tell', 'turn', 'die', 'slowly', 'till', 'hello', 'away', 'away', 'away', 'stay', 'night', 'like', 'night', 'sail', 'smile', 'ride', 'touch', 'talk', 'eye', 'love', 'win', 'cry', 'good', 'go', 'word', 'goodbye', 'away', 'away', 'away', 'away', 'know', 'leave', 'world', 'trust', 'room', 'space', 'like', 'look', 'face', 'shadow', 'shadow', 'think', 'keep', 'away', 'away', 'away', 'away']",sun away bird fly summer sky love new heart high day young night long moon stand night bird song away away away stay day like day sail sun ride rain talk tree worship wind understand leave love fill hand away away away know tell world stop turn till return good love love tell turn die slowly till hello away away away stay night like night sail smile ride touch talk eye love win cry good go word goodbye away away away away know leave world trust room space like look face shadow shadow think keep away away away away

Frank Sinatra,I Get a Kick Out of You,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet, I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see

Frank Sinatra,Young At Heart,"Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you
If you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way
Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart
And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start

Frank Sinatra,Send in the Clowns,"This is a song about a couple of adult people who have spent
Oh, quite a long time together
'Til one day, one of 'em gets restless and decides to leave
Whether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant
It's a breakup
And it's a lovely marriage of words and music
Written by Stephen Sondheim
Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
And you in mid-air
Send in the clowns
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
And one who can't move
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally finding the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines, nobody's there
Don't you love a farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

Isn't it queer

Frank Sinatra,Wave,"So close your eyes, for that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
You can't deny, don't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity
By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch the wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
When I saw you first the time was half past three

So they've got to find those extra cups to fill

You can't get cherry soda

And the way things are I'll bet they never will
They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil

You'll see no potato juice

The politician's daughter
Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You date a girl and find out later
She smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil
And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives 'em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil
No tea or tomato juice

My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)

To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

Dean Martin,Volare (Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu),"Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu sù
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings

Dean Martin,Ain’t That a Kick in the Head,"How lucky can one guy be

Do they take 'em for espresso?
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm, a girl I wish I knew

Dean Martin,Silver Bells,"City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it'll be Christmas Day

As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
(Hear the snow crush, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene)
And above all this bustle you hear

Dean Martin,C’est Si Bon,"C'est si bon (Si bon, si bon)
Lovers say that in France (Si bon, si bon)
When they thrill to romance (Si bon, si bon)
It means that it's so good
Ah, c'est si bon (Si bon, si bon)
So I say it to you (Si bon, si bon)
Like the French people do (Si bon, si bon)
Because it's oh so good
Every word every sigh every kiss dear
Leads to only one thought and it's this dear
Oh, it's ah so good (Si bon, si bon)
Nothing else can replace (Si bon, si bon)
Just your slightest embrace (Si bon, si bon)
And if you only would
Would be my own for the rest of my days
I would whisper this phrase
C'est si bon (Si bon, si bon)
The river Seine, si bon (Si bon, si bon)
The Left Bank, si bon (Si bon, si bon)
The Eiffel Tower, si bon (Si bon, si bon)
The meatballs, pizzas, school cheating, now that's stuffs pretty good too
(En voyant notre mine ravie)
Hey, watch your language
I have only one thought and it's this dear
Oh, it's so good (Si bon, si bon)
Nothing else can replace (Si bon, si bon)
Just your slightest embrace (Si bon, si bon)
And if you only would

Dean Martin,On the Street Where You Live,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town
Does enchantment pour out of every door
No, it's just on the street where you live
And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The over powering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear
People stop and stare
They don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by
I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live

Dean Martin,King of the Road,"No phone no pool no pets ain't got no cigarettes

Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright

Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob tailed nag
Two forty for his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh and
Crack you'll take the lead
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

Dean Martin,The Money Song,"If you got it, you don't need it
If you need it, you don't got it
You don't get, it shame on you
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Them that have it get more of it
Less they need it, the more they love it
And it sticks to them like glue
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Ask the rich man, he'll confess
Money can't buy happiness
Ask the poor man, he don't doubt
But he'd rather be miserable with than without
If you spend it, please be wiser
If you save it, you're a miser
You don't want it, you're cuckoo
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
La-money, mo-no-money, money-mo-no
Oh, shut up, Jerry, what are you doing?
I'm singing
This is singing?
Don't you like it?
No, I don't like it, do you wanna sing with me?
Can I sing with you?
Sure you can
All right
If I do not need it badly
Friends will give it to you gladly
But I need it, nuts to you
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
If I am lucky and I make it
You'll be frightened, but who can take it?
The Internal Revenue
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Birds don't got it, still, they sing
Eating winds up on the wing
Ideal lives some folks affirm
So, okay, you're a bird, but suppose you're a worm
It's a bad thing, oh yes, very
For the germs and sanitary
Will you have some? Oh, thank you
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
If I got it (Who's got it?), I don't need it (But I need it)
If you need it (And I need it), you don't got it (But I want it)
You can't get it, shame on you (What can I do?)
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Them that have it (Where'd they get it?), get more of it (Can they keep it?)
The less they need it (Who don't need it?), the more they love it (And how they love it)

Dean Martin,Gentle On My Mind,"It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried up on some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
Moving on the backroads by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Well, I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling caldron in some train yard
My beard a roughening coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Cupped hands 'round a tin can, I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the backroad by the river of my memory
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind

Yet I am longing to share the lot

Nat “King” Cole,Stardust,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky, the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by
Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song
Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairytale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Just your slyest embrace

Be my own for the rest of my days

They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Nebuchadnezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
And he told everybody “when you hear the music of the trombone""
And he told everybody “when you hear the music of the clarinet""
And he told everybody “when you hear the music of the horn""
You must fall down and worship the idol!""
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
But the children of Israel would not bow down!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
I said you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it oughtta be!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings

Louis Armstrong,Blueberry Hill,"I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made were never to be
Though we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
(I found my thrill)
Come climb the hill with me, baby
(On Blueberry Hill)
We'll see what we shall see
(On Blueberry Hill)
I'll bring my horn with me
(When I found you)
I'll be with you where berries are blue
(The moon stood still)
Each afternoon we'll go
(On Blueberry Hill)
Higher than the moon we'll go
(And lingered until)
Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go
(My dreams came true)
The wind in the willow played
(Do you really love me)
Love's sweet melody

Empty spaces meet his eyes
Empty arms outstretched, he's crying
Through the black of night

If it's wrong or right
I've got to go where you are

Let me be there too
Through the smoke and flame

Where you are

A reason there was

Louis Armstrong,The Bare Necessities,"The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Of mother nature's recipies
That bring the bare necessities of life
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I can't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzing in the trees
To make some honey just for me
You look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few
The bare necessities of life will come to you
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your stife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life
So just relax, yeah
In my backyard
If you act like that bee acts
You're workin' too hard
Don't spend your time, just lookin' around
For something you want, can't be found
You find out you can live without it
And go along, not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true

Down Lou'siana way
With fragrance divine, baby
And such magnificent regalia
Oh, so fine, Azalea
Oh what a lovely sight
In red, pink and white
Can't help but believe, mmm
That nothing evil can assail ya
So naïve, Azalea
You're at ease on the knees
Of the moss covered trees
Whose tops met to make a high ceiling
In the church-like pomp
Of a cypress swamp
I've yet to get that same strange feeling
I've got to go back there
And find that blossom fair
I'll always dream of
'Cause with you who could be a failure?

Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dreams
No request is to extreme

As sweet fulfillment of their secret drowns

Louis Armstrong,Spooks!,"The other night, about twelve o'clock
I thought I'd go downstairs just to check the lock
When I heard something in the house
I don't mean a mouse
I swear they were spooks, spooks, spooks
I know they were spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
I couldn't move, just stood and stared
I never was so scared
The first spook spoke and I heard him speak
He said, ""What say I go make the back door squeak?""
Oh he would tease the cat and hound the pup
And raise our spirits up
Oh lordy, them spooks, spooks, spooks
Those scary old spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
You don't have to take my word
But I heard what I heard
The next spook spoke, he said, ""Suppose we make
The faucets drip and make the shutters shake
You let me know just what you want
This is my favourite haunt""
Beware of them spooks, spooks, spooks
Them mischevous spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
I ain't spoofing, man I mean
That I seen what I seen
A big spook spoke, he said, ""Spike, my son,"" he said
""I'll show you how to scare up some fun
But next time when you wail, see here
You make it loud and clear""
Watch out for them spooks, spooks, spooks
Oh them nasty old spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
Maybe you don't think it's so
But I knew what I knew
The last spook turned to his spouse and frowned
Said, ""I thought I'd told you to wait in the ground
But you look awful cute tonight
In fact, you look a fright""
He's talking 'bout spooks, spooks, spooks
Real genuine spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
Oh, you stop putting up your dukes
You just can't fight with them spooks
I'm getting outta here, man
I don't dig this jive, no

Louis Armstrong,Let’s Do It,"When the little blue bird who has never said a word
Starts to sing, ""Spring, spring""
When the little blue bell in the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring, ""Ting, ting""
When the little blue clerk in the middle of his work
Starts the tune to the moon up above
It is nature, that's all
Simply telling us to fall in love, oh yes
And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love
Oh, the dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Just think of the Siamese twins
Some Argentines without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it, mmm
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Oh romantic sponges, they say, ""Do it""
Oysters down in oyster bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Cold cape cod clams 'gainst their wish do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love
Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks them I know
Why ask if shad do it
Waiter bring me shad roe
In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Oh, dragonflies in the reeds do it
Sentimental centipedes do it, yes
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love, (scat)
Mosquitos, heaven forbid, do it
So does every katydid do it
Oh, let's do it, mama, let's fall in love
The most refined ladybugs do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs do it
Well looka here, what's the use of balls? Mmm
Locusts in the trees do it, why, even the bees do it
Even over-educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
I said, the chimpanzees in the zoo do it
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love, oh, fall in love
I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it
Heavy hippopotami do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love
Oh, sloths who hang down from the twigs do it
Though the effort is great, yes
Sweet guinea pigs do it
Buy a couple and wait!

Well how about listening to old Pops for a minute. Seems to me, it ain't the world that's so bad but what we're doin' to it
And all I'm saying is, see, what a wonderful world it would be if only we'd give it a chance. Love baby, love. That's the secret, yeah. If lots more of us loved each other, we'd solve lots more problems. And then this world would bе a gasser
That's wha' ol' Pops keeps saying.""

I see thеm bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself

Louis Armstrong,Jonah and the Whale,"“Go and preach the Gospel to the sinful land""
But he got on a ship and he tried to get away
And he ran into a storm in the middle of the sea
Now the Lord, He made the waves just roll so high
The ship begin to sink and they all begin to cry
So they pulled ole Jonah out of the hole
And they jumped him in the water just to lighten up the load
Now the Lord made a whale, long and wide
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And he swallowed up Jonah, hair and hide
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord
Now Jonah started to pray in the belly of the whale
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
He repented of his sins like a man in jail
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord
Now Jonah must o’ been a bad man, he must o’ been a sinner
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
'Cos when the whale got him down, he didn’t like his dinner
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord
Well, he swum around the ocean, sick as he could be
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And after three days, whoops, he had to set him free
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish, mmm
So the whale spit Jonah out onto dry land
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And he went on to preaching like a righteous man
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Then the people quit their sins when they heard him in the town
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
So when you hear the call, don’t you turn the Gospel down

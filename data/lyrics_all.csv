Frank Sinatra,Fly Me to the Moon,"Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you"
Frank Sinatra,My Way,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way"
Frank Sinatra,That’s Life,"That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinning around
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, my"
Frank Sinatra,"Theme from New York, New York","Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it: New York, New York
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York
New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one
These little town blues are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York"
Frank Sinatra,The Girl From Ipanema (Garota De Ipanema),"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes ""ah""
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes  ""ooh""
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesn't see, doesn't see
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado parece um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar..
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly
Ah, porque tudo é tão triste
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesn't see
Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see
Nem olha para mim
She never sees me
Por causa do amor"
Frank Sinatra,Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas (Merry little Christmas)
Make the Yuletide gay (Make the Yuletide gay)
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas"
Frank Sinatra,Somethin’ Stupid,"I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you"""
Frank Sinatra,It Was a Very Good Year,"When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen
When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one
When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five
But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year"
Frank Sinatra,The Way You Look Tonight,"Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me, but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? 'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Lovely, don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? 'Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Just the way you look tonight"
Frank Sinatra,My Funny Valentine,"My funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day"
Frank Sinatra,I’ve Got You Under My Skin,"I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
""Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality""
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear
""Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality""
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you, under my skin"
Frank Sinatra,Come Fly with Me (Platinum Version),"Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly
Pack up, let's fly away"
Frank Sinatra,Blue Moon,"Blue moon
You saw me standin' alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me sayin' a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper, ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
Now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own"
Frank Sinatra,Strangers in the Night,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Dooby-doooby-doo
Doob-dooob-doob-dee-daa

Frank Sinatra,Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,"Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, ""Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow""
(Let It Snow!)
Oooooh-Wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, ""Let it snow, let it snow""
(I Don't Care!)
The weather outside Is frightful
But that fire Is ummm... delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
(Let it snow!)
When we've finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out In a storm
But If you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!"
Frank Sinatra,Luck Be a Lady,"They call you Lady Luck
But there is room for doubt
At times, you have a very unladylike way of running out
You're on this date with me
The pickin's have been lush
And yet, before this evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck, be a lady with me
A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice
Let's keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me, baby, I'm the fella you came in with
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, let a gentleman see
Just how nice, how nice a, a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Hey luck, be a lady with me
A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair and it's not nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice
So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me, baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck, be a lady
Luck, be a lady
Luck, be a lady tonight"
Frank Sinatra,High Hopes,"Next time you're found
With your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned
So look around
Just what makes that little old ant
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant can't
Move a rubber tree plant
But he's got high hopes
He's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time you're gettin' low
'Stead of lettin' go
Just remember that ant:
Oops, there goes another rubber tree plant
Oops, there goes another rubber tree plant
When troubles call
And your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned:
That wall could fall
Once there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram scram;
He kept buttin' that dam
'Cause he had high hopes
He had high hopes
He had high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time you're feelin' bad
'Stead of feelin' sad
Just remember that ram
Oops, there goes a billion kilowatt dam
Oops, there goes a billion kilowatt dam
All problems just a toy balloon
They'll be bursted soon
They're just bound to go, ""Pop!""
Oops, there goes another problem: Kerplop!
Oops, there goes another problem: Kerplop!"
Frank Sinatra,The Best Is Yet to Come,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
A-Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
A-Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
A-Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine"
Frank Sinatra,Autumn Leaves,"The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall"
Frank Sinatra,I’m a Fool to Want You,"I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say
Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along
Without you"
Frank Sinatra,The Lady Is a Tramp,"She gets too hungry for dinner at eight
She likes the theatre and never comes late
She never bothers with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
Doesn't like crap games with barons or earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair, life without care
She's broke and it's oke'
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight
She loves the theatre, but never comes late
She'd never bother with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
She'll have no crap games with sharpies and frauds
And she won't go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords
And she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads
That's why the lady is a tramp
She loves the free fresh wind in her hair, life without care
She's broke, but it's oke'
Hates California, it's so cold and so damp
That's why the lady, that's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp"
Frank Sinatra,You Make Me Feel So Young,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

Frank Sinatra,It Had to Be You,"Why do I do just as you say?
Why must I just give you your way?
Why do I sigh?
Why don't I try to forget?
It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, ""I had to wait""
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall 'til we met
It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and I finally found
The somebody who
Could make me be true
And could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinking of you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you"
Frank Sinatra,Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars (Corcovado),"Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea
How lovely
This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember
I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence, my love
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence, my love"
Frank Sinatra,In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,"In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never, ever think of counting sheep
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all"
Frank Sinatra,Summer Wind,"The summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts, and the summer wind
Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind
The autumn wind, and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind
Warm summer wind
The summer wind"
Frank Sinatra,All the Way,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you
All the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you
All the way
Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real
When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you
All the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years
Come what may
Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All the way
So if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All the way"
Frank Sinatra,Witchcraft,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come-hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do?
'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says ""Yes, indeed"" in me
""Proceed with what you're leadin' me to""
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says ""Yes, indeed"" in me
""Proceed with what you're leadin' me to""
It's such an ancient pitch
But one that I'd never switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you"
Frank Sinatra,The World We Knew (Over and Over),"Over and over I keep going over the world we knew
Once when you walked beside me
That inconceivable, that unbelievable world we knew
When we two were in love
And every bright neon sign turned into stars
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours
Each road that we took turned into gold
But the dream was too much for you to hold
Now over and over I keep going over the world we knew
Days when you used to love me
And every bright neon sign turned into stars
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours
Each road that we took, it turned into gold
But the dream was too much for you to hold
Now over and over I keep going over the world we knew
Days when you used to love me
Over and over I keep going over the world we knew"
Frank Sinatra,All of Me,"All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get on without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me
All of me
Come on get all of me
Can't you see
I'm just a mess without you
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Get a piece of these arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I ever make it without you
You know you got the part
Used to be my heart
So why not, why not take all of me"
Frank Sinatra,One for My Baby (And One More for the Road),"It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place, 'cept you and me
So set 'em up, Joe
I got a little story I think you should know
We're drinkin' my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
Feelin' so bad
Can't you make the music easy and sad?
I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy
Won't you listen to me
'Til it's talked away?
Well, that's how it goes
And, Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
But this torch that I've found
It's gotta be drowned or it soon might explode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
The long
It's so long
The long
Very long"
Frank Sinatra,Silent Night,"Silent night (Silent night), holy night (Holy night)
All is calm (All is calm), all is bright (All is bright)
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia (Alleluia)
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born"
Frank Sinatra,If You Go Away,"Then you might as well take the sun away;
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high;
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been, or will be again;
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go, I'll be dying slowly till the next hello
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been, or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go, I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
Please don't go away"
Frank Sinatra,The Impossible Dream (The Quest),"To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
(*)To be better far than you are(*)
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
(**)To be willing to give when there's no more to give (**)
(***)To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live (***)
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star"
Frank Sinatra,I Get a Kick Out of You,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet, I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet, I get a kick
Mmm, you give me a boot
I get a kick out of you"
Frank Sinatra,Moonlight Serenade,"I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight
I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night
The roses are sighing a Moonlight Serenade
The stars are aglow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming
My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you and I sing you a Moonlight Serenade
Let us stray 'till break of day in love's valley of dreams
Just you and I, a summer sky, a heavenly breeze kissin' the trees
So don't let me wait, come to me tenderly in the June night
I stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight
A love song, my darling, a Moonlight Serenade"
Frank Sinatra,Love and Marriage,"Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
This I tell ya, brother
Ya can't have one without the other
Love and marriage, love and marriage
It's an institute you can't disparage
Ask the local gentry
And they will say it's elementary
Try, try, try to separate them
It's an illusion
Try, try, try and you will only come
To this conclusion
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother
You can't have one, you can't have none
You can't have one without the other
Try, try, try to separate them
It's an illusion
Try, try, try and you will only come
To this conclusion
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother
You can't have one (You can't have none)
You can't have one without the other"
Frank Sinatra,Young At Heart,"Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you
If you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way
Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart
And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart
And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart"
Frank Sinatra,Send in the Clowns,"This is a song about a couple of adult people who have spent
Oh, quite a long time together
'Til one day, one of 'em gets restless and decides to leave
Whether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant
It's a breakup
And it's a lovely marriage of words and music
Written by Stephen Sondheim
Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
And you in mid-air
Send in the clowns
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
And one who can't move
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally finding the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines, nobody's there
Don't you love a farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here
Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer
Losing my timing this late
In my career?
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Well, maybe next year"
Frank Sinatra,Drinking Water (Agua de Beber),"Your love is rain, my heart the flower
I need your love or I will die
My very life is in your power
Will I wither and fade or bloom to the sky?
Água de beber
Give the flower water to drink
Água de beber
Give the flower water to drink
The rain can fall on distant deserts
The rain can fall upon the sea
The rain can fall upon the flower
Since the rain has to fall, let it fall on me
Água de beber
Água de beber camará
Água de beber
Água de beber camará"
Frank Sinatra,I’ve Got the World on a String,"I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go
I got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world
And this is the life
Hey now
I'm so in love"
Frank Sinatra,Moonlight In Vermont,"Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont
Icy finger waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont
Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of the meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont
Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze
The warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

Frank Sinatra,Wave,"So close your eyes, for that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
You can't deny, don't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity
By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch the wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity
By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch that wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
Together
Together"
Frank Sinatra,Pennies from Heaven,"Every time it rains
It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin'
All over the town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So, when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me"
Frank Sinatra,My Kind of Town,"Now this could only happen to a guy like me
And only happen in a town like this
So may I say to each of you most gratefully
As I throw each one of you a kiss, this is...
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of people, too
People who smile at you
And each time I roam, Chicago is
Calling me home, Chicago is
Why I just grin like a clown
It's my kind of town
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of razzmatazz
And it has all that jazz
And each time I leave, Chicago is
Tuggin' my sleeve, Chicago is
The Wrigley Building, Chicago is
The Union Stockyard, Chicago is
One town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town!"
Frank Sinatra,Brazil,"Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured ""Someday soon""
We kissed and clung together
Then, tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now, when twilight dims the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil
Then, tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now, when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing that I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil
That old Brazil
Man, it's old in Brazil
Brazil, Brazil"
Frank Sinatra,The Nearness of You,"It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you
When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you"
Frank Sinatra,The Coffee Song,"Coffee beans grow by the billions
So they've got to find those extra cups to fill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You can't get cherry soda
Cause they've got to fill that quota
And the way things are I'll bet they never will
They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil
No tea or tomato juice
You'll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no
The politician's daughter
Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You date a girl and find out later
She smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil
And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives 'em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil
No tea or tomato juice
You'll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no
So your lead to the local color
Serving coffee with a cruller
Dunking doesn't take a lot of skill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil"
Frank Sinatra,I’ve Got a Crush on You,"How glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you, I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive, but, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage that we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush on you, my baby, on you"
Dean Martin,That’s Amore,"(In Napoli where love is king)
(When boy meets girl)
(Here's what they say)
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie, that's amore
When the world seems to shine
Like you've had too much wine, that's amore
Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, ""Vita bella""
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay
Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella
When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming, signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore
(When the moon hits your eye)
(Like a big pizza pie, that's amore) That's amore
(When the world seems to shine)
(Like you've had too much wine, that's amore) That's amore

Just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore (That's amore)
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming, signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore
(Amore) That's amore"
Dean Martin,"Baby, It’s Cold Outside","I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside"
Dean Martin,Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,"Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight

Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu sù
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù"
Dean Martin,Ain’t That a Kick in the Head,"How lucky can one guy be
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said, ""Ain't that a kick in the head?""
The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote, ""Ain't that a hole in the boat""
My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful
I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said
Tell me quick, ain't love like a kick in the head?
Like the fella once said, “Ain't that a kick in the head?”
Like the sailor said, quote, ""Ain't that a hole in the boat?""
My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful
She's telling me we'll be wed
She's picked out a king size bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick, oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?"

All you Calabrese do the mambo like-a crazy with the

Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm, a girl I wish I knew

So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and that is one too few

When the snow comes to cover the ground

I wait for it the whole year around
Those marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees

That's how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get up and roll it along

In winter it's a marshmallow world

You can't beat the memories you've given me
Take one fresh and tender kiss
Add one stolen night of bliss

Fold it lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine, two sips of wine
Memories are made of this
Then add the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor
Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams you will savor
With His blessings from above
Serve it generously with love
One man, one wife, one love through life

I was serenely independent
And content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again
And yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks
Accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face
She's second nature to me now
Like breathin' out and breathin' in

And so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break
And yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace
Of somethin' in the air
Accustomed to her face"

Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearin' two by two
On an evenin' in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso, yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm a girl, I wish I knew
On an evenin' in Roma
Though there's grinin' and mandolinin' in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun
When the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and one is much too few
On an evenin' in Roma
Don't know what the country's comin' to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evenin' in Roma?
Though there's grining and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun
When the sun goes down
Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma
Don't know what the country's comin' to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evenin' in Roma?
Sott'er celo de Roma
On an evenin' in Roma"
Dean Martin,Houston,"Everybody puts me down
I'm a face without a name
Just walking in the rain
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I got holes in both of my shoes
Well I'm a walking case of the blues
Saw a dollar yesterday
But the wind blew it away
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I haven't eaten in about a week
I'm so hungry when I walk I squeak
Nobody calls me friend
It's sad the shape I'm in
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I got a girl waiting there for me
Well at least she said she'd be
I got a home and a big warm bed
And a feather pillow for my head
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
Well it's lonesome in this old town
Everybody put me down
I'm a face without a name
Just walking in the rain
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston"

Mister florist, take my order please
We had a silly quarrel the other day

Send them to the sweetest gal in town
And if they do the trick, I'll hurry back and pick
Your best white orchids for her wedding gown

And listen, if you can't say anything real nice
It's better not to talk at all is my advice

Good morning, sun — how are your skies above
Gee, it's great to be alive and in love

Dean Martin,Jingle Bells,"Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob tailed nag
Two forty for his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh and
Crack you'll take the lead
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells and jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Come on Prancer and Dancer
Go on, get out of here"
Dean Martin,The Money Song,"If you got it, you don't need it
If you need it, you don't got it
You don't get, it shame on you
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Them that have it get more of it
Less they need it, the more they love it
And it sticks to them like glue
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Ask the rich man, he'll confess
Money can't buy happiness
Ask the poor man, he don't doubt
But he'd rather be miserable with than without
If you spend it, please be wiser
If you save it, you're a miser
You don't want it, you're cuckoo
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
La-money, mo-no-money, money-mo-no
Oh, shut up, Jerry, what are you doing?
I'm singing
This is singing?
Don't you like it?
No, I don't like it, do you wanna sing with me?
Can I sing with you?
Sure you can
All right
If I do not need it badly
Friends will give it to you gladly
But I need it, nuts to you
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
If I am lucky and I make it
You'll be frightened, but who can take it?
The Internal Revenue
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Birds don't got it, still, they sing
Eating winds up on the wing
Ideal lives some folks affirm
So, okay, you're a bird, but suppose you're a worm
It's a bad thing, oh yes, very
For the germs and sanitary
Will you have some? Oh, thank you
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
If I got it (Who's got it?), I don't need it (But I need it)
If you need it (And I need it), you don't got it (But I want it)
You can't get it, shame on you (What can I do?)
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Them that have it (Where'd they get it?), get more of it (Can they keep it?)
The less they need it (Who don't need it?), the more they love it (And how they love it)
And it sticks to them like glue (Boo-hoo)
Funny, funny, funny what money can do
Money, money, we love you
Funny, funny, funny you can do"

And the flowers and the trees
The moon up above, and a thing called love
Let me tell you about the stars in the sky
A girl and a guy
And the way they could kiss
On a night like this
When I look into your big brown eyes
It's very plain to see
That it's time you learned 'bout the facts of life
Starting from A to Z
Let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees
The flowers and the trees
The moon up above, and a thing called love

Dean Martin,Gentle On My Mind,"It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried up on some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
Moving on the backroads by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Well, I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling caldron in some train yard
My beard a roughening coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Cupped hands 'round a tin can, I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the backroad by the river of my memory
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind
Lee-da-da-dee, da-da-dun-dun-da-da-dee"
Nat “King” Cole,L-O-V-E,"L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very, very extraordinary

Two in love can make it, take my heart and please don't break it
Love was made for me and you

Nat “King” Cole,The Christmas Song,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways, Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways, Merry Christmas to you"
Nat “King” Cole,Smile,"Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through
For you
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear
May be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you'll just smile
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you'll just smile"
Nat “King” Cole,Unforgettable,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more

In every way
And forevermore
That's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable, too
Unforgettable

And forevermore
That's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible

Thinks that I am unforgettable, too"
Nat “King” Cole,Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two),"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do
I'm half crazy all for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
There is a flower within my heart
Daisy, Daisy
Planted one day by a glancing dart
Planted by Daisy Bell
Whether she loves me or loves me not
Sometimes it's hard to tell
Yet I am longing to share the lot
Of beautiful Daisy Bell
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do
I'm half crazy all for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
We will go tandem as man and wife
Daisy, Daisy
Pedaling away down the road of life
I and my Daisy Bell
When the road's dark, we can both despise
Policemen and lamps as well
There are bright lights in the dazzling eyes
Of beautiful Daisy Bell
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do
I'm half crazy all for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two"
Nat “King” Cole,Nature Boy,"There was a boy
A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far, over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"""
Nat “King” Cole,Mona Lisa,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm? Are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?

Nat “King” Cole,When I Fall In Love,"When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I'll fall in love with you"
Nat “King” Cole,Autumn Leaves,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous, les deux ensemble
Toi que m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis"

Nat “King” Cole,Stardust,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky, the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by
Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song
Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairytale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain"
Nat “King” Cole,Orange Colored Sky,"I was walking along, minding my business
When out of an orange colored sky
(Flash! Bam! Alakazam!)
Wonderful you came by
I was hummin' a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
(Flash! Bam! Alakazam!)
I got a look at you
One look and I yell ""timber""
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in, the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
""I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I-T, it!""
I was walking along, minding my business

Mindin' my business
When love came and hit me in the eye

Out of an orange colored
Purple striped, pretty green polka-dot sky

Alakazam and goodbye
Wow, I thought love was much softer than that
What a most disturbing sound"
Nat “King” Cole,That’s All,"And a promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own
For you and you alone
That's all, that's all
I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light
Will warm the winter night
That's all, that's all
There are those, I am sure, who have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And a love time can never destroy
If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you'll adore
For now and ever more

Nat “King” Cole,Too Young,"They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all"

The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying, ""I love you""
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world​"

And miss it each night and day?
I know I’m not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger
The longer I stay away
Miss the moss-covered vines, the tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
And I'd like to see the lazy Mississippi
A-hurrying into spring
Oh the Mardi Gras, the memories
Of Creoles' tunes that filled the air
I dream of oleanders in June
And soon I'm wishing that I were there
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart?
And there's something more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans"

Com
C'est si bon
Lovers say that in france
When they thrill to romance
It means that it´s so good
C´est si bon
So I say to you
Like the french people do
Because it´s oh so good
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
C´est si bon
Nothing else can replace
Just your slyest embrace
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, my darling...
C'est si bon!"

And he told everybody “when you hear the music of the clarinet""
And he told everybody “when you hear the music of the horn""
You must fall down and worship the idol!""

Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it oughtta be!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
Talkin' to the children 'bout the power of the Gospel

Louis Armstrong,Blueberry Hill,"I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made were never to be
Though we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

Come climb the hill with me, baby
(On Blueberry Hill)
We'll see what we shall see
(On Blueberry Hill)
I'll bring my horn with me
(When I found you)
I'll be with you where berries are blue
(The moon stood still)
Each afternoon we'll go
(On Blueberry Hill)
Higher than the moon we'll go
(And lingered until)
Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go
(My dreams came true)
The wind in the willow played
(Do you really love me)
Love's sweet melody
(As I love you?)
But all of those vows we made
(Will you still remember)
Were never to be
(When the night is through?)
Though we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill"

As sweet fulfillment of their secret drowns
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and see's you through
Moma when you wished upon a star
Your dreams come true
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
As sweet fulfillment of their secret drowns
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and see's you through
Baby when you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
When you wished upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Your dreams come true"
Louis Armstrong,Spooks!,"The other night, about twelve o'clock
I thought I'd go downstairs just to check the lock
When I heard something in the house
I don't mean a mouse
I swear they were spooks, spooks, spooks
I know they were spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
I couldn't move, just stood and stared
I never was so scared
The first spook spoke and I heard him speak
He said, ""What say I go make the back door squeak?""
Oh he would tease the cat and hound the pup
And raise our spirits up
Oh lordy, them spooks, spooks, spooks
Those scary old spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
You don't have to take my word
But I heard what I heard
The next spook spoke, he said, ""Suppose we make
The faucets drip and make the shutters shake
You let me know just what you want
This is my favourite haunt""
Beware of them spooks, spooks, spooks
Them mischevous spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
I ain't spoofing, man I mean
That I seen what I seen
A big spook spoke, he said, ""Spike, my son,"" he said
""I'll show you how to scare up some fun
But next time when you wail, see here
You make it loud and clear""
Watch out for them spooks, spooks, spooks
Oh them nasty old spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
Maybe you don't think it's so
But I knew what I knew
The last spook turned to his spouse and frowned
Said, ""I thought I'd told you to wait in the ground
But you look awful cute tonight
In fact, you look a fright""
He's talking 'bout spooks, spooks, spooks
Real genuine spooks, spooks, spooks, spooks
Oh, you stop putting up your dukes
You just can't fight with them spooks
I'm getting outta here, man
I don't dig this jive, no
Wait for us, wait for us, wait for us, wait for us"

Louis Armstrong,Heebie Jeebies,"(Whatcha doing with the Heebies?)
Man, I have to have the Heebies
Yes, I got the Heebies, I mean the Jeebies
Talking about, oh, the Heebie Jeebies
Oh, most insane, hust over that strain
If you don't know it, you oughta learn it
Don't feel blue, someone will teach you
Come on now, let's do that dance
They call the Heebie Jeebies dance
Oh boy, Jeebies dance
(Scat singing)
Oh yes
Don't you know it, someone will teach you
Boy, come on down and do that dance
They call the Heebie Jeebies
Take it Trummy, chops
Man, got the Heebies
(Whatcha doing with the Heebies?)
Man, I got to have the Heebies"
Louis Armstrong,Let’s Do It,"When the little blue bird who has never said a word
Starts to sing, ""Spring, spring""
When the little blue bell in the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring, ""Ting, ting""
When the little blue clerk in the middle of his work
Starts the tune to the moon up above
It is nature, that's all
Simply telling us to fall in love, oh yes
And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love
Oh, the dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Just think of the Siamese twins
Some Argentines without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it, mmm
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Oh romantic sponges, they say, ""Do it""
Oysters down in oyster bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Cold cape cod clams 'gainst their wish do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love
Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks them I know
Why ask if shad do it
Waiter bring me shad roe
In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Oh, dragonflies in the reeds do it
Sentimental centipedes do it, yes
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love, (scat)
Mosquitos, heaven forbid, do it
So does every katydid do it
Oh, let's do it, mama, let's fall in love
The most refined ladybugs do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs do it
Well looka here, what's the use of balls? Mmm
Locusts in the trees do it, why, even the bees do it
Even over-educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
I said, the chimpanzees in the zoo do it
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love, oh, fall in love
I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it
Heavy hippopotami do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love
Oh, sloths who hang down from the twigs do it
Though the effort is great, yes
Sweet guinea pigs do it
Buy a couple and wait!
Now, the world admits bears in pits do it
Even Pekingeses in the Ritz do it
Let's do it, mama, let's fall in love"
Louis Armstrong,Cool Yule,"From Coney Island to the Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight
While the moon is bright
He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys
To give the groanies of the girls and boys
So dig
Santa comes on big
He'll come a-callin' when the snow's the most
When all you cats are sleepin' warm as toast
And you gonna flip when Old Saint Nick
Lays a lick on a peppermint stick
He'll come a-flyin' from a higher place
And fill the stocking by the fireplace
So you'll
Have a yule that's cool
Yeah, from Coney Island to the Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight
While the moon is bright
He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys
To give the groanies of the girls and boys
So dig
Santa comes on big
Come a-callin' when the snow's the most
Cats are sleepin' warm as toast
And you gonna flip when the Old Saint Nick
Lays a lick on a peppermint stick
He'll come a-flyin' from the higher place
Fill the stockings by the fireplace
So you'll
Have a yule that's cool
Have a yule that's cool
Yeah, cool yule"

You look like something's botherin' you
(Ain't nothin' bothering me honey
That a piece of roast beef can't fix up)
Well I'll tell you one thing Pops
A man works hard then comes on home
Expects to find stew with that fine ham bone

Louis Armstrong,Takes Two to Tango,"Why? 'cause it takes two to do this dance! Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Lets do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love
You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or a nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own
Ther's a lot of things that you can do alone!
But ...
Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Lets do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love
You can stare at the moon by yourself
Take a laugh like a loon by yourself
Spend a lot, go to pot on your own
There's a lot of things that you can do alone!
But listen here...
Takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
Lets do the tango, do the tango
Do the dance of love
Ohh seeee..."
Louis Armstrong,What A Wonderful World (Original Spoken Intro Version),"How about all them wars all over the place? You call them wonderful?
And how about hunger and pollution? That ain't so wonderful either.""
Well how about listening to old Pops for a minute. Seems to me, it ain't the world that's so bad but what we're doin' to it
And all I'm saying is, see, what a wonderful world it would be if only we'd give it a chance. Love baby, love. That's the secret, yeah. If lots more of us loved each other, we'd solve lots more problems. And then this world would bе a gasser
That's wha' ol' Pops keeps saying.""
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see thеm bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue, and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces, of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, sayin', ""How do you do?""
They're really sayin', ""I love you""
I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh yeah!"
Louis Armstrong,Jonah and the Whale,"“Go and preach the Gospel to the sinful land""
But he got on a ship and he tried to get away
And he ran into a storm in the middle of the sea
Now the Lord, He made the waves just roll so high
The ship begin to sink and they all begin to cry
So they pulled ole Jonah out of the hole
And they jumped him in the water just to lighten up the load
Now the Lord made a whale, long and wide
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And he swallowed up Jonah, hair and hide
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord
Now Jonah started to pray in the belly of the whale
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
He repented of his sins like a man in jail
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord
Now Jonah must o’ been a bad man, he must o’ been a sinner
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
'Cos when the whale got him down, he didn’t like his dinner
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord
Well, he swum around the ocean, sick as he could be
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And after three days, whoops, he had to set him free
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish, mmm
So the whale spit Jonah out onto dry land
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And he went on to preaching like a righteous man
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Then the people quit their sins when they heard him in the town
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
So when you hear the call, don’t you turn the Gospel down
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish, mmm"

Louis Armstrong,On the Sunny Side of the Street,"Grab your coat, grab your hat, baby
Leave your worries on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
On the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear that pitter-pat
The happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade, oh
But I'm not afraid, baby
My rover crossed over, yes
If I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller, yes
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
And get your coat, grab your hat
Leave your worries on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
On the sunny side of the street, (scat)
Can't you hear that pitter-pat
Oh, the happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade, yes
With those blues on parade, now mama
Now I'm not afraid, baby
(Scat), yes
And if I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller, babe
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street"
